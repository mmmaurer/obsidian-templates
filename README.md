# Obsidian Templates
These are some templates I use for my note taking setup.

I use the Templater plugin to carry over information from recurring notes, such as daily notes [(Daily Note Template)](Daily%20Note%20Template.md), and regular meetings [(PhD Meeting Template)](PhD%20Meeting%20Template.md).

For literature notes, I use the ZotLit plugin to import metadata from Zotero. Templates for this are stored in the [ZtTemplates](ZtTemplates) folder.
